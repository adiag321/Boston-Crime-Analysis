# <a align = 'center'>Boston Crime Analysis</a>

Crime incident reports are provided by Boston Police Department (BPD) to document the initial details surrounding an incident to which BPD officers respond. This is a dataset containing records from the new crime incident report system, which includes a reduced set of fields focused on capturing the type of incident as well as when and where it occurred. Records in the new system begin in June of 2015. </br>

The Analyze Boston Data Exports posted now are the updated incident data from the Mark43 RMS Database which launched in September of 2019 and is complete through present with the exclusion of data that falls under MGL ch.41 s.98f. The 2019 data that was originally posted contained combined exports from the Intergraph RMS and the Mark43 RMS during 2019 but the Extract/Transfer/Load process was not updated during the transition. We are continuing work on producing the gap data from January 2019 to September 2019 from our legacy Intregraph RMS and will be publishing this as soon as the work is complete.</br>

The Data is collected from the following Link: <a href = "https://data.boston.gov/dataset/crime-incident-reports-august-2015-to-date-source-new-system"> Link </a> </br>
